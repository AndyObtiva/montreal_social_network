# Montreal Social Network
## Ruby on Rails Hotwire/Turbo Web App Built at Montreal.rb Nov 2025 Hacknight

Montreal Social Network is a Ruby on Rails Hotwire/Turbo web app built during the [Montreal.rb Nov 2025 Hacknight](https://www.meetup.com/montrealrb/events/311445998/).

It has partial progress that will be continued in Hacknight Part 2 on December, 17, 2025.

## Event Description

Hacknight: Build a Social Network with Rails Hotwire/Turbo [2h]

Learn Rails Hotwire/Turbo by building a very basic social network web app (similar to X). You can get help in building the web app from other developers at the event. If the project is not done by the end of the event, we will have a part 2 event the following month. The exercise matters more than meeting all the requirements as it enables practicing Ruby programming skills with Rails and Hotwire/Turbo while potentially collaborating with other developers for learning and information exchange.
